  <h1> Chrome Extension Talpa</h1>
</div>

Talpa is a Chrome extension for streamlining string ID identification process. No more endless scrolling or manual searching â€“ with Talpa, just hover over any string and instantly see its corresponding ID.

## Development
- Make sure [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) is installed, nothing else is required
- Run `bun install`
- Run `bun run dev`, extension will be built in `dist` dir and file watcher will start
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` page, click "Load unpacked" and select `dist` dir (this needs to be done only once)
- After new changes the extension will reload automatically, tab where extension is used needs to be reloaded manually. Sometimes extension reload fails and then it needs to be reloaded manually from `chrome://extensions/` page.

## Publish extension
- Make sure to update package.json version
- Run `bun run build`
- Upload `dist/chrome-extension-talpa.zip` to Chrome Store
